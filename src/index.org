* Introduction
  The dashboard should provide every related information of a lab that is
  either hosted or is in the list for hosting.  
* Requirements

  1. Ability to view virtual lab information - related to labs, institutes, disciplines,
     technologies, developers, etc.

  2. Ability to run different queries on this virtual lab information.
     + what are the hosted labs of an institute
     + what are the labs from an institute that are at level 0?
     + what are the technologies used by an experiment of a particular lab?

  3. Hosting - whether a lab is hosted at IIIT or AWS, or Badal or at a
     respective university

  4. Provide an interface to update virtual lab information to keep it current
     and relevant. Only authorized users will be able to update the information.
     
  5. To get and save data, at the back-end, it connects to the dataservice
     (which is already part of the Central Platform services).

  6. The underlying data store should be able to incorporate expanding data
     information of a lab.

  7. When a lab is deployed, the dashboard should reflect the updated
     information.  This means integration with ADS.
     
  8. Compatibility of Technologies. 

  9. Analytics for each lab
